# pongGame
This game is my personal spin on the classic game of pong. The player can chose whether they want to play against :
1. The computer
2. Against another person
3. Watch two computers play against each other

The player then enters their name, and selects the game difficulty from a sliding bar. The right hand side player uses the `4 arrow keys` 
to control their paddle, and the left hand side player uses the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
The game ends when one side reaches **10 points**, from which the end screen is displayed

The farther the slider is to the right, the faster the `AI` paddle reacts to the ball, making the game harder.
A lower difficulty corresponds to a slower `AI` paddle.

As can be seen from the above photo, each player's score is shown next to their name.
